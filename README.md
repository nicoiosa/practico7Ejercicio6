# Rolling Food Blog Backend

## Welcome

Welcome to Rolling Food Backend, the heart of our delicious recipes platform! Here, we handle the server-side operations, managing our database, and ensuring smooth interactions between users and our recipe collection.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** A powerful NoSQL database for storing recipe data efficiently.
- **Express:** A lightweight web application framework for Node.js, ideal for building robust APIs.
- **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, simplifying interactions with the database.
- **Nodemon:** A utility that automatically restarts the server when changes are detected, enhancing development workflow.
- **Cors:** A middleware for Express to enable cross-origin resource sharing, crucial for client-server communication.
- **Morgan:** A HTTP request logger middleware for Express, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
- **Dotenv:** A module for loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env, ensuring secure configuration.
- **Express-Validator:** A middleware for Express to validate and sanitize incoming request data, enhancing security and reliability.
